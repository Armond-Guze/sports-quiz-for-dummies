# SPORTS QUIZ FOR DUMMIES

## PROJECT-4 OF RUTGERS CODING BOOTCMAP COURSE

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Created sports quiz program with timer and ability to save your highscores

## HTML 
We first created an HTML page to apply the basic structure of our program, and classified our selectors to position them in our CSS and Javascript

## CSS
Our Stylesheet was simple but intuitive. A white box in the center of the screen displays the game while the background matches the button coloring functions

## playQuestion FUNCTION
We first selected our "Start-Btn" class and made a function to start the game when clicked for the Javascript

## JAVASCRIPT STRUCTURE
Our Javascript was broken into multiple parts, starting with our variables. From there we created objects for our questions and answers, eventually leading into our local storage.
